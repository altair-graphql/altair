For quick one-time usage or to see how it works, you can also use the [web app](https://altair-gql.sirmuel.design/): [https://altair-gql.sirmuel.design/](https://altair-gql.sirmuel.design/)

Note
{: .label .label-yellow }
It is **NOT** recommended to use the web app for full development, because there are some limitations there which might lead to frustrations if something isn't working as expected. It is preferred for you to use the desktop apps where possible, or the browser extensions for ease of use.


### Usage with express
You can use altair with an express server using [altair-express-middleware](/docs/integrations/altair-express-middleware).
