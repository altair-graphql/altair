# Managing your account

To get started with Altair GraphQL Cloud, you need to sign up for an account. To access the login dialog, hover the user icon at the bottom left corner of Altair and click on the `Login` link.

Currently the only way to sign up for an account is by using Google Sign-In. If you don't have a Google account, you can create one [here](https://accounts.google.com/signup). _(If you think there should be other ways to sign up, please let us know by [contacting support](/docs/cloud/support).)_

Once you've signed in, you now have access to manage your account and teams, and to log out.

Your profile shows you basic stats about your account, such as the number of queries you have created and the number of teams you manage.
