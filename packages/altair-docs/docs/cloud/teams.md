# Teams

A team is a group of users who share a workspace where they can share and collaborate on queries and collections. You can create teams, add members to teams, and manage team members. You can learn more about managing queries and collections [here](/docs/cloud/queries).

To get started with managing teams, you must first sign in to your account. Then you can access the teams dialog by clicking on the `Teams` link in the user menu.

From here you can manage your teams and their members. Note that only the team owner can manage the team and its members.
