# Using Altair GraphQL plugins

<!-- ![enabled plugins in settings](/assets/img/docs/add-plugin-in-settings.png) -->

[Several plugins](/docs/plugins/popular-plugins) have been created and published. Using these plugins in Altair is pretty simple and straightforward. Just add the plugin name to the list of enabled plugins in the settings pane and restart Altair to get it.

Note: with chrome manifest version 3, you can no longer use v2 plugins. You can only use v3 plugins.
