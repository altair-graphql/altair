# Multiple Languages

With support for multiple languages, Altair allows you to use the app in your preferred language, making it easier and more intuitive to work with the GraphQL API. You can switch between languages in Altair by choosing this in the settings dialog.

Altair currently supports several languages including English, Chinese, French, Spanish, Russian, German, Brazilian, Vietnamese, Romanian among others. If you would like to use Altair in a language that is not currently supported, you can help contribute to the translation efforts by submitting translations for your language [here](https://altair-gql-translate.surge.sh/).

Available languages can be found [here](https://crowdin.com/project/altair-gql).
