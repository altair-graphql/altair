# Import and Export Queries

You can export your queries from Altair as `.agq` files, which can be shared with other Altair users and team members, who can then import the query into their own Altair instance using the import functionality.

To export a query, you can select the query in Altair, and then click on the "Export window" button in the Save menu (the floppy disk icon). This will open a dialog where you can choose the location and filename for the .agq file.

To import a query, you can click on "Import window..." from the settings menu, and then select the .agq file that you want to import.

You can export the query you are working on and import the `.agq` file into another device
(also supports drag and drop). This is also useful for sharing queries with variables and headers
with other members of your team.
