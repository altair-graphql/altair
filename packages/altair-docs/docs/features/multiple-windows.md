# Window management

Altair provides the option to open multiple windows each with a distinct state that is preserved across browser sessions. In addition, you can give each window a custom name. Each window can be used to work on different queries or projects, with distinct endpoints, headers, etc. You don't have to be limited to working on a single query at a time!
