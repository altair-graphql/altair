# Browser request monitoring (beta)

The [browser extensions](/docs/#available-platforms) provide a way to monitor the GraphQL requests made on your site or web application without leaving the site. This allows you to see and inspect the requests made to the GraphQL server in real-time.

This feature is currently in beta ðŸ§ª and is available in the latest Chrome and Firefox browser extensions. We'd love to hear your feedback on this feature, so please feel free to [reach out](https://github.com/altair-graphql/altair/discussions) to us on GitHub with your thoughts and suggestions.

## Monitoring requests

To get started, first you need to install the Altair browser extension for your browser, and then open the developer tools and navigate to the Altair GraphQL panel. Altair will automatically detect the GraphQL requests made on the page and display them in the panel, allowing you to inspect the GraphQL queries and responses.

## Viewing in Altair

You can also import the request data into the Altair app by clicking on the "**Open in Altair**" button in the request panel. This will open the Altair app with the request data pre-filled, allowing you to inspect the request in more detail and interact with the GraphQL server with more flexibility using all the features available in the Altair app.
