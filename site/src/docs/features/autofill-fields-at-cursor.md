# Autofill all fields at cursor

You can insert all fields of the type at cursor using `Ctrl+Shift+Enter`. You can change the autocompletion depth limit using a `"addQueryDepthLimit"` option in the settings.

Note: This only works for the query fields, and not for the arguments at the moment. You can still [generate whole queriea and fragments](/docs/features/add-queries-and-fragments) directly from the docs along with their arguments filled in.
