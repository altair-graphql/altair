# Collections

As the number of GraphQL operations you work with increase, you would want to be able to organize and group all these queries in a nice and easy way. This is where collections come in.

**Collections** allow you to save your related queries together into collections and sub collections (for even more scoped queries).

You can also import/export collections for easy sharing with other members of your team.
